# gesture-control
a python script that uses cv2 and mediapipe to track hand gestures and use them as an input device

fullcustom.py is the main script rn, obviously still very WIP

# dependencies

fullcustom.py depends on:
cv2 (is also responsible for the videooutput that might not work on systems using the wayland
display server, depending on compilation options)
mediapipe
time
math
subprocess
threading
